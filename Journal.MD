DAY 1 "20/06/2025": Circuit Diagram and PCB design

Today, I spent 5 hours working on my RC tank's circuit diagram and PCB design.
My software of choice was Kikad. This was not my first time using Kikad, but my first time utilising the PCB editor feature.
I have never needed nor designed a PCB, but I found it fit well into my project.
I ran into problems assigning the correct footprints as well as transitioning the circuit diagram and organising the PCB.
With a little bit of research and with some time, I overcame these. The circuit diagram and PCB will be displayed below.

DAY 2 "21/06/2025": BOM

Today, I spent another 5 hours researching for my BOM.
I relied primarily on AliExpress for parts due to high-rated reviews and unbelievably low prices
I've displayed all the parts, their quantity, their model, lowest price and finally linked its webpage.
I have spent $80.18 AUD with my overall budget being $231.75 AUD
The BOM will be displayed below.


DAY 3 "22-25/06/2025": 3D Print

Over the past 3 days I have spent 15 hours designing the 3D print for my RC Tank.
As a noobie 3d designer the process was quite hard with my software of choice being onshape.
The main challenges wasnt the big component such as the chasis but rather the treads, connectors and screw holes.
Keeping dimensions correct also posed a problem. 
I've learned a lot through these sessions and plan on doing the code, polishing the project, and submitting tomorrow.
The design will be displayed below.

DAY 4 "26/06/2025": Code
