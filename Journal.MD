DAY 1 "20/06/2025": Circuit Diagram and PCB design

Today, I spent 5 hours working on my RC tank's circuit diagram and PCB design.
My software of choice was Kikad. This was not my first time using Kikad, but my first time utilising the PCB editor feature.
I have never needed nor designed my PCB, but I found it fit well into my project.
I ran into problems assigning the correct footprints as well as transitioning the circuit diagram and organising the PCB.
With a little bit of research and with some time, I overcame these. The circuit diagram and PCB will be displated below.



DAY 2 "21/06/2025":  BOM

Today, I spent another 5 hours researching for my BOM.
I relied primarily on AliExpress for parts due to high-rated reviews and unbelievably low prices
I've displayed all the parts, their quantity, their model, lowest price and finally linked its webpage.
The BOM will be displayed below.
