DAY 14 "16/06/2025": Circuit Diagram ann PCB design

Today I spent 5 hours working on the circuit diagram and PCB design for my RC tank.
My software of choice  was Kikad . THis was not my first time using kikad but it was my first time utilising the PCB editor feature.
I have never needed nor designed my own PCB but I found it was fit well into my project.
I ran into problems assigning the correct footprints aswell as transitioning the circuit diagram and organising the PCB.
With a little bit of research and with some time I overcame these problems.
Circuit diagram and PCB will be linked below.
